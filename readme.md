This is a fork of Chart.js by Nick Downie, http://www.chartjs.org.
I have added support for error bars, and two new Chart types: 
box-and-whisker and Scatter. The Scatter type supports calculation of a 
trendline.

I have also added a Chart calculator, in 
which an array is passed in place of a single datapoint. The position of 
the data point is calculated from the average (or median) of the data in 
the array and the error bars are calculated as range or Standard 
Deviaiton.

Documentation of the new features is available at http://www.brittle-star.com/portfolio/readme/?readme=chart.js.
